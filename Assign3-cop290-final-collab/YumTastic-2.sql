Make sure these are the HARD lady fingers, NOT the soft ones!\r\n* 2 C strong coffee/espresso\r\n* 9 Tbsp rum or marsala wine (you can half this for a less pronounced alcoholic flavor; I thought this was just right :)\r\n* 1 C heavy cream\r\n* 1-1.5 lb mascarpone\r\n* 2/3 C sugar, divided\r\n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\r\n* 2-3 Tbsp cocoa powder\r\n* Handful of chopped chocolate/chocolate shavings (optional)\r\n\r\n**Method:** \r\n\r\n1. **Prepare coffee/alcohol for dipping:** Combine coffee in a wide, shallow bowl, and combine with about 5 Tbsp of the rum. Set side.\r\n2. **Prepare mascarpone/cream mixture:** Whip heavy cream with 1/3 C sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 2 Tbsp rum, until you have soft peaks. Then, slowly fold in the mascarpone along with the other 1/3 C sugar and 2 Tbsp rum. Whip altogether until nice and fluffy. Set aside.\r\n3. **Prepare tiramisu layers:** Dip each side of a lady finger into the coffee/rum mixture for no more than 1-2 seconds per side (DO NOT DIP TOO LONG; This is the biggest mistake in making tiramisu. NO SOGGINESS!). Then, carefully lay in a pan (8x5 in), making sure all the ladyfingers are lined up side by side; trim if needed to fix snuggly into pan. Then, add a generous, even layer of the mascarpone/cream mixture on top of the ladyfingers, smoothing them out on the edges with a spatula. Dust with some cocoa powder with a colander/sieve. Repeat the ladyfinger layer with the final mascarpone layer, and dust the top with cocoa powder and chocolate shavings if using.\r\n4. **Refrigerate tiramisu** for at least 6 hours to allow it to set, and allowing the lady fingers to soften well. Cut with a clean knife, wiping off between slices for the cleanest edges, and enjoy!', 'rye-dinner-rolls-with-crisp-tops-352316.jpg', 2044),

Let it sit for a minute or two while you�re gathering your other ingredients. \r\n* Next, add sugar, eggs, butter, salt, and vanilla, and mix well. Lastly, using a dough hook, add flour and mix until it forms a firm yet tacky dough that pulls away from the edges. Resist adding more flour&the dough should be slightly tacky.\r\n* Remove dough from the mixer and knead by hand, on a lightly floured surface, for 5 minutes (yes, even if you used a stand mixer).\r\n\r\n#### First Rising\r\n\r\n* Grease a large bowl with butter or cooking spray. Place the dough in this bowl, cover with a warm towel, and let sit in a warm spot for 1 to 1-½ hours or until it doubles in size.\r\n\r\n#### Cinnamon Roll Filling\r\n\r\n* In a bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it resembles a paste.\r\n\r\n#### Rolling out the dough, adding filling, and cutting into shape\r\n\r\n* For this step, I used silicone baking mats, but you can also roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring approximately 22� x 14�.\r\n* Drop some of the cinnamon roll filling here and there over the rolled out dough. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently spread the filling all over the dough, keeping away from the edges by about a quarter inch.\r\n* Starting at a short end (one of the 14� ends), gently but tightly roll the dough into one long roll.\r\n* Using a sharp knife (I found that a serrated knife worked best), cut the roll into 12 evenly sliced pieces. \r\n\r\n#### Second Rising\r\n\r\n* Preheat oven to 350	.\r\n* Place the cut cinnamon rolls into a parchment-lined baking dish, three rows of four. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes, or until they�ve nearly doubled in size.\r\n\r\n#### Baking Cinnamon Rolls\r\n\r\n* Remove the plastic wrap and place baking pan in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 20 � 30 minutes. My cinnamon rolls took 30 minutes to bake, but you should start checking on them after 20 minutes. All ovens are different. The cinnamon rolls will be done when the tops have just lightly browned and the dough sounds hollow when you lightly tap on it with a spoon. The rolls will rise even more while they�re baking and will most likely touch each other. This is fine and good&they�ll stay soft in the middle.\r\n\r\n#### Icing for Cinnamon Rolls\r\n\r\n* While the rolls are baking, make the icing. Using either a stand mixer or handheld mixer, blend together cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla until smooth. \r\n* When the cinnamon rolls are done baking, let them cool about 5 minutes and add icing to the tops, so it will slightly melt and ooze between the swirls. If you prefer the icing thicker on top, wait until they�ve fully cooled.', 'deviled-ham-and-pickle-sandwiches-352286.jpg', 3432),

Then transfer the rice into the rice cooker and add a small piece of kelp along with 3/4 cups plus 2 1/2 tbsp of water. Cook according to your rice cookers instruction.\r\n* Combine 2 tbsp rice vinegar, 1 tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp salt in a medium bowl. Mix until everything is well combined.\r\n* After the rice is cooked, remove the kelp and immediately scoop all the rice into the medium bowl with the vinegar and mix it well using the rice spatula. Make sure to use the cut motion to mix the rice to avoid mashing them. After thats done, cover it with a kitchen towel and let it cool down to room temperature.\r\n* Cut the top of 1 avocado, then slice into the center of the avocado and rotate it along your knife. Then take each half of the avocado and twist. Afterward, take the side with the pit and carefully chop into the pit and twist to remove it. Then, using your hand, remove the peel. Repeat these steps with the other avocado. Dont forget to clean up your work station to give yourself more space. Then, place each half of the avocado facing down and thinly slice them. Once theyre sliced, slowly spread them out. Once thats done, set it aside.\r\n* Remove the wrapper from each crab stick. Then, using your hand, peel the crab sticks vertically to get strings of crab sticks. Once all the crab sticks are peeled, rotate them sideways and chop them into small pieces, then place them in a bowl along with 2 tbsp of Japanese mayo and mix until everything is well mixed.\r\n* Place a sharp knife at an angle and thinly slice against the grain. The thickness of the cut depends on your preference. Just make sure that all the pieces are similar in thickness.\r\n* Grab a piece of seaweed wrap. Using a kitchen scissor, start cutting at the halfway point of seaweed wrap and cut until youre a little bit past the center of the piece. Rotate the piece vertically and start building. Dip your hand in some water to help with the sushi rice. Take a handful of sushi rice and spread it around the upper left hand quadrant of the seaweed wrap. Then carefully place a couple slices of salmon on the top right quadrant. Then place a couple slices of avocado on the bottom right quadrant. And finish it off with a couple of tsp of crab salad on the bottom left quadrant. Then, fold the top right quadrant into the bottom right quadrant, then continue by folding it into the bottom left quadrant. Well finish off the folding by folding the top left quadrant onto the rest of the sandwich. Afterward, place a piece of plastic wrap on top, cut it half, add a couple pieces of ginger and wasabi, and there you have it.', 'lemon-snow-pudding-with-basil-custard-sauce-352321.jpg', 3203),

Whoever did it, did a good job, the sauce is one of the most popular in the world thanks to its mild and delicate flavour. In short, it is the smooth tomato-based curry sauce with the addition of **garam masala** and finished with yoghurt. The sauce is usually served with dry roasted marinated chicken or lamb (Tikka).

Whip the egg whites until stiff. When the egg whites are well whipped, gradually add the granulated sugar until the mixture is very firm. At this point gently add the egg yolks and whip again for 5 seconds. Sift the flour and add it by hand to the mixture (with a spatula), trying to mix the ingredients as best as you can.\r\n\r\nWhile the two layers of biscuit are cooling down, prepare the Mousseline cream and the syrup. For the syrup, mix the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring periodically. Cook for 3 minutes, continuing to stir. For the Mousseline cream, divide both the butter and the sugar into two equal doses. Extract the seeds from the vanilla pod and heat the milk by inserting one of the two parts of sugar together with the seeds and the vanilla bean. You have to bring it to a boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes, so as to infuse the taste of vanilla into the milk. Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the starch and the remaining sugar. After a while, to facilitate whisking, add a little hot milk. Remove the vanilla pod from the boiling milk and add the egg mixture, stirring vigorously with the wooden spoon. Cook over very low heat until the cream has thickened well, in any case for at least 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and add one of the doses of butter, continuing to stir until it has completely dissolved. At this point, the cream must be allowed to cool until it reaches room temperature. When the cream is cooled, put it in the mixer and start whipping it at high speed. Cut the remaining amount of butter into small squares and gradually add it to the cream, continuing to whip. When the mixture is completely homogeneous and uniform, the mousseline cream is ready.\r\n\r\nWash the strawberries and cut them in half vertically, trying to make pieces all the same height. Before you start cutting them, select the most beautiful strawberry, which you will leave aside so that you can use it for the final decoration. Take the ring and use it to cut two perfect circles of Savoyard.\r\n\r\nStart assembling the cake by inserting the acetate strip into the ring and inserting the various layers one after the other. Start with a layer of biscuit, which you will wet with a generous dose of syrup. Then, with the help of the sac-a-poche, make a first fairly thin layer of mousseline cream. Make a ledge of strawberries along the edge of the ring, placing the cut part of each strawberry in direct contact with the acetate. Cut the leftover strawberries into big pieces and fill the centre. Still using the pastry bag, fill each empty space with the Mousseline, starting from the edges of the cake, and make a final layer of cream over the strawberries. Place the second Savoyard biscuit on the cream, and wet this too with the syrup. Put the cake to cool in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes and in the meantime prepare the Chantilly cream.\r\n\r\nWhip the cream in the mixer starting with a medium speed and gradually increasing until you reach the maximum speed. When the cream begins to grow in volume, gradually add the sugar. Continue whipping until smooth and satiny.\r\n\r\nTake the cake from the refrigerator, remove both the acetate and the ring. With the help of the spatulas make an even layer of cream on top of the cake.\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\nVideo-Tutorial and full recipe:\r\n\r\n[https://guerinoscakes.wordpress.com/2021/02/19/strawberry-cake/](https://guerinoscakes.wordpress.com/2021/02/19/strawberry-cake/)', 'lemon-mint-braised-artichokes-352323.jpg', 4438),

Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to combine. Pat the mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, pressing the crumbs firmly in an even layer on the bottom and making sure they come at least halfway up the side of the pan.

Add the Creole Cream Cheese and vanilla paste and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl once more. Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Continuing to mix past that point, even though the batter won’t look different, only incorporates extra air, which will cause the cheesecake to bubble excessively and the surface to crack as that air tries to escape during the baking process.\nDecrease the oven temperature to 350°F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly.

Let rise for 1 hour.\nRepeat this series of folds one more time, allow it to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. The longer the dough is refrigerated, the more flavor it will have. After this rise, it’s ready to be shaped; bear in mind that, once it’s shaped, it will need more time for a final rise, so plan ahead.\nWipe a bit of canola oil on a large baking sheet. Dump the dough onto a clean, dry counter, and use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut it into eight equal pieces; make clean, decisive cuts rather than use a sawing motion, so you don’t deflate all the air inside.\nLightly flour your hands and place one palm directly over the dough ball, with all your fingertips touching the counter to make a sort of “cage” around the dough. Roll it in brisk, small circles on the countertop so it tightens itself into a smoother, more taut ball.\nSpace the rounds of dough a few inches apart, seam side down, on the sheet, and roll to coat them lightly in oil. Tightly cover the sheet with plastic wrap so the dough doesn’t dry out, and let them rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 more hours, until they’re pillowy.\nMeanwhile, set a baking stone on the center rack of your oven and turn on the broiler. You’re emulating a 700°F wood- burning oven, so you need to give the stone a good long while to preheat before you bake.\nWhen the dough is ready, lightly flour a work surface, and use a bench scraper or thin metal spatula to coax one piece into your palm; be sure you don’t manhandle it or you’ll force out the pockets of air that formed while it rose. Dust a little more flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin.\nWith firm, even pressure, briskly roll the dough a few times along its length. Flip it upside down, rotate it a quarter- turn, and roll it the same way, keeping it as round as possible. Repeat, dusting a little extra flour as needed, until it’s about 6 inches across.\nThis next part happens fast and furiously, so make sure you have no distractions—screaming children and natural disasters will have to wait. Use tongs or a good oven mitt to pull the oven rack with the baking stone partially out. Carefully pick up the pita, drape it over your palm, and slap it down onto the stone as if you’re giving it a high- five (just be careful not to touch the hot stone!). Set a timer for 1 minute, and close the oven. Broilers vary in strength but all are quite hot, so don’t turn your back on the oven or the pita may burn. Check on it— it should puff up and build in color, with some beautiful blistered spots. If it’s still pale, close the oven and let it keep baking for 30- second intervals.\nUse tongs to flip the pita, and let it finish baking with the oven door cracked so you can watch it finish. Pull it out when the second side is as pretty as the first; this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your broiler.\nBake off the rest of the dough this way; as you get the hang of it, feel free to bake two pitas at a time. Serve these hot or at room temperature.', 'fresh-homemade-pita-alon-shaya.jpg', 656745, '[‘tasty’,’healthy’]'),

(if using fresh beans, add the kombu now). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and cut the celery, carrot, and leek into about 3 in. pieces. As soon as the water boils, decrease the heat to medium-low and add the vegetables to the pot, along with the whole shallots and minced garlic. Continue to cook at a gentle simmer until the beans are very creamy, 60 to 90 minutes for dried beans and about half that for fresh.\nRemove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to reserve the tomatoes; remove and discard the other vegetables.\nSet up a sieve over a heat proof container and strain the beans (there should be about 3 cups or 480 g), reserving all the cooking liquid.\nIn a blender, combine 1 cup (160 g) of the cooked beans with 2 cups (480 ml) of the cooking liquid, plus the tomatoes, anchovies, oil, maple syrup, salt, red pepper flakes, and mustard. Purée until extremely smooth, pour into a large bowl, and fold in the reserved cooked beans by hand. At this point, you can serve it right away or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, gently rewarming over medium-low heat when you’re ready to serve.\nWhile the bean soup is cooking, preheat the oven to 325°F. Cut the bacon into ¼ in. lardons; reserve 3 whole beans for garnish and cut the rest into 2 to 3 in. pieces.\nIn a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, spread the bacon in an even layer and cook over medium-low heat until it starts to turn golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces but leave the fat behind.\nIncrease the heat slightly, and sauté the shallots until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped beans, bacon, and red pepper flakes. Cover with a lid or a tight layer of foil and bake until the beans are very soft, 60 to 90 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, juice, and garlic as soon as the beans come out of the oven and cover again; the residual steam will cook the garlic.\nThinly slice the pickled green beans on the bias. Combine with the cherry tomatoes, oil, and vinegar.\nTo serve, ladle the bean soup into bowls with a big spoonful of the baked beans on top. Garnish with the pickled green bean mix, a swirl of tomato brown butter, crumbled feta, and torn fresh herbs. Leftovers can all be refrigerated in separate airtight containers, though the green bean salad is best on the day it’s made, when the beans are most crisp and the tomatoes are fresh.\nThis works for any amount of dense vegetables or dense, underripe fruit, either whole or cut up, such as carrots, turnips, beets, winter squash, onions, green beans, Brussels sprouts, green tomatoes, small apples, underripe peaches, and whole baby cabbages. Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water you’re adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you don’t have an airlock, you’ll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60°F to 68°F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks.
